# Sorting_Visualizer

# 🔢 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A sleek and interactive web application for **visualizing sorting algorithms step-by-step**. Perfect for students, educators, and anyone interested in learning how sorting works through real-time animations.

> 🚀 Built with HTML, CSS, and modular JavaScript (Vanilla JS). No frameworks, no libraries — just clean code and powerful logic.

## ✨ Features

- 🎥 **Real-time Animation** of sorting algorithms
- 📊 **Statistics Tracking**: comparisons, swaps, time taken
- 🎛 **Custom Controls**:
  - Choose sorting algorithm
  - Set animation speed
  - Adjust array size
- 🎨 **Responsive Design** with dynamic bar visualization
- ✅ Fully modular JavaScript file structure

## 📌 Supported Algorithms

| Algorithm       | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| 🫧 Bubble Sort     | O(n)      | O(n²)         | O(n²)        |
| 🔍 Selection Sort | O(n²)     | O(n²)         | O(n²)        |
| 🪜 Insertion Sort | O(n)      | O(n²)         | O(n²)        |
| ⚡ Quick Sort     | O(n log n)| O(n log n)    | O(n²)        |
| 🧬 Merge Sort     | O(n log n)| O(n log n)    | O(n log n)   |
